# [Project-Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)
Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts graduates and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. This repository will feature my solutions to these said problems via python.

#### [Problem 1](https://github.com/jingle77/Project-Euler/blob/main/Problem_1.ipynb)
#### If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


#### [Problem 2](https://github.com/jingle77/Project-Euler/blob/main/Problem_2.ipynb)
#### Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
